# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Packages: react-router-dom

I covered some important and beautiful topics about react basic concepts. The full application will demonstrate the concepts in real-time interactions.

Steps:
Open CMD and type:
1. npm create vite@latest.
2. Follow the steps and options you want for your application.
3. npm install react-router-dom
4. npm run dev
   Good To go..!
